# Champo-Carpet-Case
IMPROVING BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS SALES USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS

In my recent project, I analyzed a business case for Champo Carpets, a prominent carpet manufacturer, facing challenges with low conversion rates from sample carpets to customer orders. Using data-driven approaches, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights, such as dominant carpet types, customer preferences, and sales patterns. I then applied machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to predict order conversions, with KNN and Random Forest delivering the best performance. To further enhance business strategies, I implemented k-means clustering for customer segmentation, identifying actionable groups based on purchase behaviors and preferences.

Additionally, I developed a collaborative filtering recommendation system using similarity measures like cosine similarity to recommend tailored products to customers. By combining advanced analytics and R programming, this project provided actionable solutions to optimize conversion rates, improve customer engagement, and drive revenue growth.
